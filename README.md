# Google Play Store Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

## Introduction:
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering performed on a dataset from the Google Play Store. The dataset encompasses various attributes of mobile applications available on the platform, ranging from their names and categories to user ratings and installation counts.

## Dataset Information:

The dataset comprises the following features:

#### App: The name of the application.
#### Category: The category under which the app falls.
#### Rating: The rating of the application on the Play Store.
#### Reviews: The number of reviews the app has received.
#### Size: The size of the app.
#### Installs: The number of installs of the app.
#### Type: Whether the app is free or paid.
#### Price: The price of the app (0 if it is free).
#### Content Rating: The appropriate target audience of the app.
#### Genres: The genre under which the app falls.
#### Last Updated: The date when the app was last updated.
#### Current Ver: The current version of the application.
#### Android Ver: The minimum Android version required to run the app.
## Approach:

The analysis and feature engineering process encompass the following steps:

#### Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing inconsistencies in the dataset.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the distribution of each feature, identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers.
#### Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models.
#### Visualization: Visualizing key insights and findings to facilitate interpretation and communication.
## Conclusion:

The analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the characteristics and trends observed in the Google Play Store dataset. By leveraging EDA and feature engineering techniques, we endeavor to extract meaningful information that can aid stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding app development, marketing strategies, and user engagement efforts.
